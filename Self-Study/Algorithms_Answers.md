## Exercise I Answer

### a

'A' is logarithmic O(log n). The 'while' loop determines how many times N will be multiplied by with each loop.

'B' is linear O(n). I counted the number of for-loops by the number of operations within each loop. It is a nested loop. 

'C' is O(n). The if statement is constant, but the second return requires it perform additonal operations, making it Linear.
